Falsy Bouncer

Remove all falsy values from an array. Return a new array; do not mutate the original array.

Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.

Hint: Try converting each value to a Boolean.

Hint1:
Falsy is something which evaluates to FALSE. There are only six falsy values in JavaScript: undefined, null NaN, 0, ""(empty string), and false of course.

Hint2:
We need to make sure we have all the falsy values to compare, we can know it, maybe with a function with all the falsy values...

Hint3:
Then we need to add afilter() with the falsy values function...
