Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false.

Boolean primitives are true and false.



This program is very simple, the trick is to understand what a boolean primitive is. The programs requires a true or false answer.

Hint 1
You will need to check for the type of the parameter to see if it is a boolean.

Hint 2
To check for the type of a parameter, you can use typeof.

Hint 3
Since you must return true or false you can use if statements or just have it return the boolean used for the if statement.
