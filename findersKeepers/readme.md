Finders Keepers

Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'true test'. This means that given an element x, the 'true test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined.

Problem Explanation

We need to return the element form an array that passes a function. Both the function and the array are passed into our function findElement(arr, func).

Hint 1
We need to return the element from an array that passes a function. Both the function and the array are passed into our function findElement(arr, func). Looking through the array can be done with a for loop.

Hint 2
num is passed to the function. We will need to set it to the elements we want to check with the function.

Hint 3
Do not forget, if none of the numbers in the array pass the test, it should return undefined.
